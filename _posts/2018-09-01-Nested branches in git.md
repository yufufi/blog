If you use nested branches in git, some planning (or predefine structure) could be useful. [Turns out](https://coderwall.com/p/qkofma/a-caution-about-git-branch-names-with-s) the last part of your nested branch (e.g. `foo` in `feature/foo`) is a file. Therefore, you cannot create `feature/foo/bar` once `feature/foo` is created. If you think you will nest branches multiple levels, better prepare for it via some convention like `feature/foo/main` and then you can branch to `feature/foo/bar`.
