I've been tryign to bring up a single page application for a course project. Here's what I like to remember:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is a simple library that offers plenty of easy to use and nice looking components. I ended up using the `navbar`.
* `JQuery` has a slim version that doesn't have the `.ajax` function. The "Getting Started" page for bootstrap refers to slim version.
* If you want some interactive maps on your web site, consider looking into [datamaps](https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps).
* You can have [variables in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) and [do math](https://css-tricks.com/keep-math-in-the-css/) with them.
* Use [viewport](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp) when you're setting sizes.
